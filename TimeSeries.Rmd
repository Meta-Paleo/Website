title: "Time Series"
---

**Aim**: To design a standardised protocol for the analysis of palaeontological time series data.

Time series analysis has become a widely used suite of methods in quantitative Palaeobiology. However, there remains little consensus on the optimal ways to implement the methodology, given that it comprises a complex series of options throughout the different stages.

This project can be openly contributed to on [GitHub]().

## Project concept

 This project will include aspects such as:

* How to treat missing data; 
* The optimal method of 'detrending'; 
* Autoregressive models;
* How to treat residual data, and statistical biases; and
* Model-fitting and correlation analyses.

## Key links

## Contributing

Time Series is an open project that anyone can contribute to on [GitHub](https://github.com/Meta-Paleo/TimeSeries). All data sources, methods, code, and results are openly shared for collaboration and inspection as the project evolves.

We strongly encourage others to participate in the project, propose their own ideas, and to contribute or re-use any of the data or other information available here.
