## Project concepts
The purpose of this project is to design a standardised protocol for the analysis of palaeontological time series data. This will include aspects such as:

* How to treat missing data.
* The optimal method of 'detrending'.
* Autoregressive models.
* How to treat residual data, and statistical biases.
* Model-fitting and correlation analyses.

This project can be openly contributed to on [GitHub](https://github.com/Meta-Paleo/TimeSeries).
