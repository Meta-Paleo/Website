# An Open project
 
This project adheres to the principles of Open Science, in that all content and methods are openly and immediately shared to encourage collaboration and re-use.

Want to propose something else? All data, code, methods, and live results are available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Meta-Paleo/) project page. 

Anyone can contribute anything they want to this, irrespective of past experience. Contributions are automatically tracked guaranteeing attribution and project authorship.

Each project is indexed on Zenodo as part of the [Meta-Paleo Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/meta-paleo/). Here, each time a project is updated on GitHub as a new version, the new content and contributions are automatically integrated into the community project space, and granted an updated DOI. Neat huh.
