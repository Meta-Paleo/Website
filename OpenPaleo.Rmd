## Project concept

The idea of this project is to perform a range of meta-analyses into the published Palaeontology literature. This will include looking at factors such as:

* Quantitative analysis of the 'openness' of Palaeontology research.
* Citation frequences for different journals, compared to their impact factors.
* How aware researchers are that they may have signed away copyright.

We strongly encourage others to participate in the project, propose their own ideas, and to contribute or re-use any of the data or other information available here.

Ultimately, this information might prove useful in developing standards, protocols, and best practices for palaeontological research and publishing.

This project can be openly contributed to on [GitHub](https://github.com/Meta-Paleo/OpenPaleo).
